// Jelly cheat sheet

<< Order >>

        Put whatever is important in here, my idea for how we could organize stuff would be by just putting the names 
    of the variables, functions and classes all in alphabetical order while having something like a comment next to it 
    to point out what file they come from. 

    An example would look like this:

        Line(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int thickness = 1);    // Does blah blah blah you know (Line.cs)

    you could suggest a better way to organize it, but that's the only idea i got really, i based it off mainly on the
    way i tend to organize my own world building documents.

Below there are two starting categories you could use, you can add more as you go.

<< Rendering >>


<< Systems >>
